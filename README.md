# Once Ruby test

### How To
The test is composed of multiple levels that you have to solve in ascending order. Please try to do the simplest thing to solve the level you're currently working on, and not over engineer things.
As the complexity increases after each level, you'll eventually need to re-use some code, refactor it and add layers of abstraction using OOP.

What we're interesting to see:
 - Code that works :) Don't focus too much on algorithm performance, even if that would love to see efficient code as well
 - Clean code
 - Good levels of abstraction when needed
 - Robust to errors (use exceptions, think about corner cases)

For each level, please write as well in ANOTHER LANGUAGE of your choice (so, anything but Ruby) a black-box test giving inputs to the ruby program, and veryfing validity of the output (with given inputs and/or JSON inputs of your choice).
